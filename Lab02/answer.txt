1. If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Yes, Java allows this. This is called constructor overloading — defining multiple constructors in a class with different parameter lists.
2. Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
 Java is strictly Pass by Value.

But here's the catch:

Primitive types (int, float, etc.): value is copied.

Objects: the reference (memory address) is passed by value — so the reference itself is copied, but still points to the same object.
3. After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?
Because Java passes object references by value, so swapping references inside a method doesn’t affect the original references outside.
4. After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()), why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?
Because you're modifying the object that the reference points to, not the reference itself.
